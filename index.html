      <p>Dear KrishnaAcharya,</p>
      <p>I want to start by saying I’m truly sorry.</p>
      <p>Deactivating my Instagram out of rage was unfair to you. It came from a place of frustration I didn’t handle well, and I shut out someone who’s been incredibly important to me. You didn’t deserve that. I regret making you feel hurt or excluded.</p>
      <p>You matter to me, and I hope we can move past this. I’m here — honest, apologetic, and hopeful.</p>
      <p>With sincerity,<br>[Your Name]</p>
